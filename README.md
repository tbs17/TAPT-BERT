# TAPT-BERT
Refer to the paper: Classifying Math Knowledge Components via Task-Adaptive Pre-Trained BERT, proceedings of AIED2021.

#### Preprocess Data
+ We have 3 types of data: CCSS description data, video title data and problem texts
  + You can find partial description and video title data in the 'Dataset/Pre-train' folder. 
    + The other part of the description and video title will remain private per provider's request.
  + For problem texts, the provider would like to keep it private so we can't make it available to the public
#### Create pretraining data and train for TAPT
